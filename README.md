Advent of Code 2022 Solutions
===

These are my solutions for [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022/). The naming scheme for the main files in this repo is `/(\d{2})(_1)?\.(txt|rb|hs)/`, where `$1` gives the day of the challenge, `$2` indicates if it's an alternative input provided by advent of code (some questions provide shorter test cases that are more immediately decipherable), and `$3` gives the filetype. Text files (.txt) are the inputs from the advent calendar, and Ruby and Haskell files (.rb and .hs) are programs that implement solutions. 

Note that Advent of Code is a timed event, and I'm publishing my code unedited! If it's ugly that's not on me. 

Don't look at any of these solutions if you haven't tried the problem yourself!
